# Graiphic Whitepaper Series

Welcome to the **Graiphic Whitepaper Collection**, a public series of technical papers documenting our work on **graph computing**, **AI orchestration**, and **hardware integration**.

Graiphic develops the world’s first system unifying **AI + Logic + Hardware + Energy** under a **single ONNX-based graph** — fully editable, executable, and measurable through **LabVIEW** and our in-house toolkits.

---

## 🧭 Philosophy of the Series

At Graiphic, everything begins with the **graph**.

We use **ONNX** not only as a model format, but as the **universal file system** describing the logic, dataflow, and hardware orchestration of an entire application.  
Our LabVIEW-based IDE and toolkits act as the graphical editors and compilers for these ONNX graphs.

Execution follows two complementary paradigms:

1. **IR-last (current)** — **ONNX Runtime** with optimized **Execution Providers** (CUDA, TensorRT, OpenVINO, ROCm, Xilinx, Qualcomm...).  
2. **IR-first (next)** — **MLIR** compilers (IREE, OpenXLA, oneAPI...) for ahead-of-time specialization and deterministic deployment.

This dual IR strategy keeps ONNX as the single source of truth while giving us runtime breadth today and compiler-grade control tomorrow.

### 🧩 Graph Execution Philosophy

</p>

- **ONNX = File system & abstraction layer**  
- **LabVIEW = Visual IDE & orchestration cockpit**  
- **Graiphic Toolkits = ONNX authoring + editing + execution bridges**  
- **IR-first / IR-last = compilation vs runtime orchestration**

### 🚀 Positioning in the AI Stack

Graiphic operates in the **disruptive zone** — where AI becomes deployable, autonomous, and hardware-independent.

## 📚 Whitepapers

### **1. GO HW — From Models to Systems (v1.3)**
**Theme:** Unified hardware orchestration in ONNX  
**Summary:** GO HW extends ONNX beyond inference to real-time control of physical systems. It introduces GPIO, DMA, ADC/DAC, timers, and energy-aware monitoring as ONNX nodes, enabling deterministic, low-latency execution on SoCs.

### **2. Benchmarking the Future: Comparing LabVIEW GPU Toolkits — CuLab, G²CPU, and the Graiphic Accelerator (v1.0)**
**Theme:** Performance comparison of LabVIEW GPU acceleration frameworks  
**Summary:**  
This study evaluates the **Graiphic Accelerator Toolkit** against **CuLab** and **G²CPU**, measuring computational throughput, memory efficiency, and runtime determinism under identical LabVIEW test environments.  
The benchmark covers **four workloads** — **GEMM**, **Arithmetic**, **Complex Number Computation**, and **Signal Processing** — and highlights Graiphic’s **compiled ONNX graph execution** advantage versus DLL-based frameworks.
