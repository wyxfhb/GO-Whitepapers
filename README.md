# Graiphic Whitepaper Series

A concise collection of Graiphic’s technical publications covering **graph computing**, **AI orchestration**, and **hardware-software integration**.  
Each whitepaper resides in its own folder with the corresponding PDF and, when applicable, associated source material.

## 📄 Whitepapers & Repositories

### **1. GO HW — From Models to Systems (v1.3)**  
**Theme:** Hardware orchestration through ONNX  
**Summary:** GO HW extends ONNX into a deterministic control layer for physical systems, introducing GPIO, DMA, ADC/DAC, timers, and energy-aware primitives as ONNX nodes. It establishes a unified approach for real-time execution on CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and embedded SoCs.

### **2. Benchmarking LabVIEW GPU Toolkits — CuLab, G²CPU, Graiphic Accelerator (v1.1)**  
**Theme:** Performance comparison of GPU acceleration toolkits  
**Summary:** A reproducible benchmark suite evaluating GEMM, arithmetic pipelines, complex operations, and signal-processing workloads across CuLab, G²CPU, and the Graiphic Accelerator Toolkit under identical LabVIEW conditions.

### **3. GO GenAI — From Fragmentation to Orchestration (v1.0)**  
**Theme:** Unified orchestration of Generative AI through ONNX  
**Summary:** GO GenAI converts ONNX into a dynamic, executable system graph where models, tokenizers, logic, data streams, and hardware execution are orchestrated visually inside the SOTA LabVIEW environment. It provides deterministic multi-hardware execution, graph-level optimization, and a continuous pipeline from model import to deployment—without Python or glue code.
