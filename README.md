# Graiphic Whitepaper Series

A curated collection of Graiphic’s technical publications covering **graph computing**, **AI orchestration**, **knowledge-driven learning**, and **hardware–software unification**.  
Each whitepaper resides in its own folder with the corresponding PDF and, when applicable, associated source material.

## 📄 Whitepapers & Repositories

---

### **1. SOTA — The LabVIEW IDE for Graph Computing (v1.0 — upcoming)**  
**Theme:** ONNX-native authoring, compilation, and orchestration inside LabVIEW  
**Summary:**  
SOTA provides a full-stack environment where engineers can build, edit, optimize, train, and deploy ONNX graphs visually inside LabVIEW.  
It serves as the foundation of Graiphic’s unified stack, enabling graph-based orchestration across GO HW, GO GenAI, and GO IML.

### **2. GO HW — From Models to Systems (v1.3)**  
**Theme:** Hardware orchestration through ONNX  
**Summary:**  
GO HW extends ONNX into a deterministic system-control graph including GPIO, DMA, ADC/DAC, timers, and energy-aware primitives.  
It enables real-time graph execution across CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, NPUs, and embedded SoCs using a single ONNX artifact.

### **3. GO GenAI — From Fragmentation to Orchestration (v1.0)**  
**Theme:** Unified orchestration of Generative AI through ONNX  
**Summary:**  
GO GenAI turns ONNX into a dynamic execution fabric that coordinates models, tokenizers, data streams, logic, and hardware runtimes.  
It provides deterministic, multi-provider execution and removes the need for Python glue code, enabling fully visual orchestration through SOTA.

### **4. GO IML — From Theory to Superiority (v1.0)**  
**Theme:** Informed Machine Learning: merging data, physics, logic, and expert knowledge inside the ONNX graph  
**Summary:**  
GO IML introduces a new paradigm where **constraints, equations, rules, priors, and domain knowledge become first-class elements of the ONNX training graph**.  
It allows training pipelines to integrate physical laws, symbolic logic, mission rules, and structured priors directly into the optimization process—without separate engines or code.

Key capabilities:  
- constraint-aware neural networks (physics, logic, causal structure),  
- hybrid data + knowledge training loops defined visually inside SOTA,  
- ONNX-native informed components (PhysicsConstraint, RuleGate, PriorLoss…),  
- portable deployment on CPU/GPU/FPGA/NPU using standard ONNX Runtime,  
- superior generalization, fewer data requirements, and more robust real-world behavior.

GO IML completes the triad formed by GO HW (graph-to-hardware) and GO GenAI (graph-driven generative intelligence), establishing a unified, sovereign stack for **Physical AI**.
