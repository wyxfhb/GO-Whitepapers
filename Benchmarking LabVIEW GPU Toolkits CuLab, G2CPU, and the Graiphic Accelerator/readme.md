# 📊 Benchmarking the Future: Comparing LabVIEW GPU Toolkits  
**CuLab, G2CPU, and the Graiphic Accelerator**

Welcome to the **Graiphic Benchmarking Whitepaper Repository**, where we share the **methods, results, and LabVIEW sources** used to compare the main GPU acceleration toolkits for **LabVIEW**.

This repository accompanies the official whitepaper:  
👉 [**Benchmarking the Future: Comparing LabVIEW GPU Toolkits CuLab, G2CPU, and the Graiphic Accelerator (v1.1)**](./Benchmarking%20the%20Future%20Comparing%20LabVIEW%20GPU%20Toolkits%20CuLab%2C%20G2CPU%2C%20and%20the%20Graiphic%20Accelerator.1.1.pdf)

## 🧩 Overview

This benchmark measures and compares the **performance**, **integration**, and **determinism** of several LabVIEW GPU toolkits — all tested in the same LabVIEW environment.

### Toolkits Compared
- **Graiphic Accelerator Toolkit**
- **CuLab GPU Toolkit 4.1.2.80** (Ngene)
- **G2CPU GPU and CPU HPC Toolkit 1.6.0.15** (Natan Biesmans)
- **Native LabVIEW CPU execution**

The objective is to provide a **real-world comparison** and understand the trade-offs between speed, scalability, and ease of integration.

## 📚 Benchmarks Included

1. **GEMM Processing**  
   Matrix multiplication followed by arithmetic post-processing.  
2. **Arithmetic Operations**  
   Iterative Add / Neg / Mul / Div loops for element-wise operations.  
3. **Complex Number Computation**  
   Handling of real + imaginary tensors using ONNX custom nodes.  
4. **Signal Processing Application**  
   FFT + arithmetic operations on **real NI-like signal data (~32 k samples)**.  
   ➤ This test was designed to reflect realistic, small-scale sensor workloads — not synthetic stress tests.

## 🧠 Key Findings

- **Graiphic Accelerator (TensorRT)** achieves the **highest performance**, up to:  
  - ⚡ **5× faster than CuLab**  
  - ⚡ **40× faster than G2CPU**  

- **Compiled-graph execution (ONNX Runtime)** significantly reduces overhead versus **per-node DLL execution**.

- **Complex-number support** is functional via custom ONNX nodes — an open research topic for future native integration.

- For **small data blocks**, CPU execution remains competitive; GPU benefits grow with workload size.  
  ➤ The goal is *understanding performance behavior*, not claiming absolute superiority.

## 🔬 Replication & Discussion

This benchmark was built for **transparency, reproducibility, and community collaboration**.  
All materials (VIs, datasets, configurations) are public — anyone can rerun or extend the tests.

We strongly encourage:
- 🔁 Independent replication using different GPUs, CPUs, or LabVIEW versions  
- 📈 Comparative submissions via pull requests or GitHub issues  
- 🧩 Proposals for new test cases (e.g., deep learning workloads, larger FFTs, etc.)  
- 🧠 Constructive discussion on methodology and interpretation  

> **Benchmarking is not competition — it’s collaboration.**  
> Our goal is to build shared understanding, not to declare winners.

📢 **Discussion board:** Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Graiphic/whitepapers/issues) to post replication results, observations, or suggestions.

## 🧮 Towards a Community Standard: LabVIEW Open Benchmark Suite (LOBS)

Following this first Graiphic benchmark, we’ve launched the  
**[LabVIEW Open Benchmark Suite (LOBS)](./LabVIEW%20Open%20Benchmark%20Suite)** —  
a collaborative initiative inspired by **SPEC** and **MLPerf**, aimed at building  
a **shared, reproducible standard** for LabVIEW performance evaluation.

LOBS extends this initial study by providing:
- 🧠 **Open-source, vendor-neutral test cases** (FFT, GEMM, AI, etc.)  
- 🔁 **Reproducible pipelines** anyone can execute and extend  
- 📊 **Transparent comparison criteria** (time, precision, energy, determinism)  

If you want to replicate or contribute to the next wave of open benchmarks,  
👉 start here: [**LabVIEW Open Benchmark Suite →**](./LabVIEW%20Open%20Benchmark%20Suite)

> This whitepaper is the **Reference 0** of the suite —  
> the foundation on which all future community benchmarks will build.
